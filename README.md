# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

 My motivation is because my brother may find it helpful to have a loose working example of what can be done with a serface level of understanding of code so far as HTML and JavaScript are concerned.
 
 A few things I learned while building this project were that I over estimated the ammount of effort that I would have to put into this project which honestly is a weight off my chest, and how important it is to double or even tripple check the spelling and Syntax used while coding since just being a single letter off could halt your progression even days later.

## Useage

To use the Prework Study Guide as intended you may review the notes within each section, if you dont have any one thing in particular you are looking to study you may always open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), doing so will open a console panel either on the side or at the bottom of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) and the console will give you a suggested topic to study first.
